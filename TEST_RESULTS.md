## Frontend Component Tests
- **Status**: ✅ Passing
- **Details**:
  - Fixed the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error in useForm.js 
  - Fixed dependency array management to prevent infinite updates
  - Completely rewrote frontend tests using modern testing practices:
    - Added proper test utilities with renderWithProviders
    - Implemented MSW for API mocking
    - Used userEvent instead of fireEvent
    - Improved test isolation and readability
- **Solution**:
  - Corrected the useForm.js dependency array
  - Added memoization for complex objects
  - Created test-utils.js for consistent component rendering
  - Set up MSW server for API mocking
  - Rewrote all component tests:
    - AuthContext.test.js
    - Login.test.js
    - Register.test.js
    - ForgotPassword.test.js
    - ResetPassword.test.js
    - Profile.test.js
    - Dashboard.test.js
    - Admin.test.js

## Cypress E2E Tests
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially Fixed
- **Details**:
  - Made significant improvements in test reliability and structure
  - Updated rate limiting settings for testing environments
  - Fixed token extraction in API testing scripts
  - Added better environment setup for testing
- **Solutions Applied**:
  - Modified security middleware to relax rate limits in test environments
  - Fixed API token extraction in test scripts
  - Created test environment setup scripts with correct environment variables
  - Fixed some test-specific issues:
    - api_health_check.cy.js: All tests passing
    - login.cy.js: All tests passing
    - profile.cy.js: All tests passing
    - forgot-password.cy.js: Basic page loading tests passing
  - Still working on:
    - admin.cy.js: Authentication issues need to be resolved
    - dashboard.cy.js: UI elements not being found correctly
    - register.cy.js: Registration completion issues
    - routing.cy.js: Navigation issues
    - smoke_test.cy.js: Basic app loading issues

## Overall Status
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Successfully installed all required dependencies
- **Backend API**: ✅ Server running successfully and responding correctly
- **Frontend Application**: ⚠️ Builds but has some UI/functionality issues
- **Testing Environment**: ⚠️ Improved but still has port conflict issues
- **API Tests**: ✅ All API tests passing
- **Cypress Tests**: ⚠️ Some tests passing, others still failing

## Next Steps
