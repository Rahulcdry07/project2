# Test Status Report

## API Tests
- ✅ Health Endpoint: Working correctly
- ✅ Authentication: Login successful, token retrieved
- ✅ Profile Endpoint: Returns user profile data
- ✅ Admin Users Endpoint: Returns list of users
- ✅ Metrics Endpoint: Prometheus metrics being collected

## API-Focused Cypress Tests
- ✅ API Tests: Full API functionality verified
- ✅ API Health Check: All endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Smoke Tests: Core functionality working as expected

## Cypress UI End-to-End Tests
- ❌ Admin Tests: Authentication issues
- ❌ Dashboard Tests: UI elements not found
- ❌ Forgot Password: Reset requests not working properly
- ❌ Registration: Some completion issues
- ❌ Routing: Mixed results on page navigation

## Issues and Solutions

### Fixed Issues:
1. API response parsing in test_api.sh - Token extraction corrected
2. Rate limiting for tests - Increased limits for test environments
3. Database permissions - Ensured test database is writable
4. Testing environment setup - Created proper environment with migrations and seeding
5. API testing - Comprehensive API tests now passing

### Pending Issues:
1. React app loading in Cypress tests - The app build exists but UI tests fail to find elements
2. Authentication token handling in UI tests
3. UI element selectors may need updating

## Current Approach
We have separated the testing strategy:
1. API functionality is thoroughly tested via API-specific Cypress tests
2. Core functionality verified through API smoke tests
3. UI tests remain a work in progress 

## Next Steps
1. Create mock frontend components for UI testing
2. Consider implementing component testing for React components
3. Add API testing to CI pipeline with new `run_api_tests.sh` script
4. Document the split testing strategy (API vs UI)
