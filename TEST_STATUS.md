## Test Status and Troubleshooting

### Current Status
The tests have been implemented for both backend and frontend components. However, there are some hanging issues with the frontend tests due to the complex component structure and dependencies.

### Backend Tests
The backend tests are running with some timeouts and email sending errors (which is expected in the test environment), but 16 tests are passing. These tests cover:
- Authentication endpoints (register, login, validate token)
- Profile management
- Admin functionality
- Password reset and email verification

### Frontend Tests
The frontend React component tests are experiencing hanging issues due to:

1. Complex component interdependencies
2. Difficulties mocking the AuthContext and React Router properly
3. Async operations that may not be resolving as expected

### Recommendations for Running Tests

1. **For Backend Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/project2
   npx mocha test/backend.test.js --timeout 10000
   ```

2. **For Frontend Tests**:
   - Run tests for individual, simpler components first:
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/project2/public/dashboard-app
   npm run test:debug -- --testPathPattern=Login.test.js
   ```
   
   - For complex components like Dashboard, Admin, etc., consider:
     - Breaking down the components into smaller, more testable units
     - Testing each piece separately
     - Using more robust mocking strategies

### Common Test Issues and Solutions

1. **React Router Navigation Issues**:
   - Ensure useNavigate is properly mocked
   - Use jest.fn() for the mock implementation
   - Test navigation effects separately from rendering

2. **AuthContext Issues**:
   - Create simplified mock implementations
   - Test authentication logic separately from UI components
   - Use dependency injection where possible

3. **Async Operation Timeouts**:
   - Increase test timeouts
   - Ensure all promises are resolved
   - Use waitFor with reasonable timeouts

4. **API Call Mocking**:
   - Use explicit mock implementations
   - Return consistent test data
   - Test error handling separately

### Next Steps for Improving Tests

1. Refactor components to be more testable
2. Separate business logic from UI for easier testing
3. Use more granular test files for specific behaviors
4. Consider using testing-library's userEvent instead of fireEvent for more realistic testing
